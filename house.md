## Automation

Home automation consists of the following:

- Amazon Alexa
  - Each room has a device
  - Wake word is `Alexa`
- Google Home
  - Testing it as a replacement for Alexa
  - Just the one device in the living room
  - Wake phrase is `Hey Google`
- Phillips Hue
  - Lights in all rooms
  - Motion sensor in kitchen and dressing room
- Hive
  - Hot water stored in a tank so not "on demand" and needs to be on in advance
  - Radiators in key rooms have smart valves
  - Thermostat is in the hallway above the shelving unit
- Smart plugs
  - Lights (on timers)
    - Indoor hearts on the Juliet window
    - Lights on the stairs
    - Outdoor Christmas lights
  - Others
    - Desk in my room
    - Desk in Nathalie's room
    - Dishwasher (always on)
    - Storage device in my room (always on - device sleeps)

### Grouping

Various groups have been created for ease of controlling them and these are the names:

- Bunny (my room)
- Rainbow (Nathalie's room)
- Hallway
- Living Room
- Kitchen
- Bedroom (our shared room)
- Dressing Room

The Alexa device in that room is tied to the group so you don't need to say the group name if you're in that room, for example saying `Alexa, lights off` whilst in the living room will turn off just the lights in that room.

### Heating

Hive will be the trickiest thing to control if you don't have the app installed, but I can give you the account details so that you can use the app on your phone if you want to.

Here are the commands you'll need in order to work the heating:

| Command                                     | Description                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Alexa, activate all rooms`                 | All rooms for 2 hours                          |
| `Alexa, activate cosy living room`          | Living room radiators to 19 degrees for 1 hour |
| `Alexa, activate toasty living room`        | Living room radiators to 21 degrees for 1 hour |
| `Alexa, activate worker bunnies`            | Bunny and Nathalie's radiators for 2 hours     |
| `Alexa, boost the hot water for 15 minutes` | Boost the hot water for 15 minutes             |

When it comes to hot water, we've turned the schedule off which is normally 15 minutes every morning which is enough to give us plenty of hot water for our needs. The first time you come to ours, boost the hot water for 30 minutes and then boosting 15 minutes a day should be fine for you. If you want to get a bath, then boost it for another 15 minutes before you run it just to make sure you don't run out of water.

### Example Commands

- Lights
  - When in a room, e.g. living room:
    - Alexa, lights on
    - Alexa, lights off
    - Alexa, lights 20%
    - Alexa, lights full
    - Alexa, lights red
  - When in a different room:
    - Alexa, living room lights on
    - Alexa, living room lights off
- Rooms
  - Alexa, living room on
    - Will turn on lights
  - Alex, bunny on
    - Will turn on lights and my desk

## Other Things

### Bedding

You can sleep down in Nathalie's room and the bed's ready for you and there are many pillows to choose from. You can find towels in the airing cupboard opposite the 3rd floor bathroom.

### Food

The cupboards are pretty empty at the moment as we have a moth problem and we have no idea where they're coming from, so we've binned all opened grain/food packets in case that's the source. If you do see any moths flying around, please evict/expire them.

### Plants

The plants shouldn't need watering but, if you do come to ours, I may message to kindly ask for a few to be watered which I can give you details of.

### TV

The TV has a device connected to it called Nvidia Shield which is an Android device designed for gaming that's also incredible for streaming **and** is capable of controlling both the TV and AV receiver, so you don't need to mess about with multiple remotes. The remote is small and is a triangular prism so it's pretty only but should also be the only remove out.

You can use Disney+ and Prime Video (use my profile when prompted), and Netflix is on there but it's Nathalie's sister's account which now keeps on nagging to enter a verification number since Netlfix have banned password sharing.
